The Open Procurement project aims to support public release and reuse of data. The project will develop a platform to make procurement easier, more transparent, and efficient. We will use the internationally tested School of Data-model to involve stakeholders (journalists, companies, civil servants) in the platform development and to coach them in harvesting and visualizing data.

1. A platform prototype visualizing procurement data
2. The platform will be co-created in the School of Data, which will coach (a) at least ten public institutions in publishing and reusing their data, and ten journalists in data reuse and (b) deliver open resources to build wider capacity in Sweden.
3. Recommendations on how to improve access to and reuse of public procurement data in Sweden based on an assessment of the data published on the platform and on feedback from stakeholders.
